===========

About
-----

Job's Done is a tool heavily inspired by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), and works in the same way in that configuring a file (`.jobs_done.yaml`) in your repository's root directory should be all you need to create and trigger Continuous Integration jobs.

Documentation

Documentation and examples are available in [Confluence](https://eden.esss.com.br/confluence/display/EDEN/Creating+CI+jobs+with+Job%27s+Done)
